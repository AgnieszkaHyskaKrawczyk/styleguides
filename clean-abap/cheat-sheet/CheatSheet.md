# Cheat Sheet

The Clean ABAP **Cheat Sheet** summarizes the [Clean ABAP](../guide/CleanABAP.md)
guidelines in a shortened format optimized for printout.

For your convenience ("is this printout on my desk still up to date?"),
the cheat sheet - in contrast to the general styleguide -
is versioned according to the [Semantic Versioning specification](https://semver.org/).
