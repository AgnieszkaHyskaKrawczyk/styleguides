This guide is an adoption of
[Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)
for [ABAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP).

## About this guide

### Public

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [About this guide](#about-this-guide)

This document is **public**, as described in our
SAP's _Global Information Classification & Handling Standard_
[(internal link)](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1891700683),
meaning you can freely share it with anybody.

We believe that everybody should be enabled to code cleanly.

### Optional

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [About this guide](#about-this-guide)

Following this guide is **optional**, meaning you -
or more precisely: your team -
can choose whether you want to adhere to it.
This applies equally to in-house developers, partners, and customers.

We believe that clean code comes from the heart, not from pressure.

### Continuous Release

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [About this guide](#about-this-guide)

This guide is updated **continuously**,
meaning any change is reviewed and immediately put "live",
without special publication versions.

ABAP and our understanding of Clean Code evolve,
and this document will evolve along.

We believe that this document is "work in progress"
and will probably never see a status "finished";
as agile developers, we welcome this.

### Open Source

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [About this guide](#about-this-guide)

This repository is **open source**,
meaning it is written by a loose community of interested persons,
and anybody from within and without SAP is invited to contribute.

[LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) describes how you may use this material,
while [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how you can contribute.

We believe that clean code should be discussed freely and openly.

### Grassroots Project

> [Clean ABAP](#clean-abap) > [Content](#content) > [About this guide](#about-this-guide)

This guide is a **grassroots project**, meaning it was started, and is still driven,
by programmers who spend their day coding, and want to get better at it.

We are developers, architects, quality engineers, and consultants,
from associates to chief experts, from language creators to tool developers,
from S/4HANA to the foundation.
We respect all roles, ranks, and units, and welcome any suggestions and improvements.
